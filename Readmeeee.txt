I think I can actually program again!

I need to talk to you in person, so we can work on this project though.
I improved the layout of the repo, so we now have a srcs, and includes area.

I also added my own makefile, which lets us do a few nice things.
You no longer need direct paths for including .h files.

You can just use "#include <libft.h>".

I did replace your libft with my own, hope that's not a problem! If it is, just put yours back in.

Everything seems to compile perfectly. :)
